# Public Transport Impact Analysis – LEZ Expansion Nordstadt

## 1. Introduction
This document assesses the impact of the proposed Low Emission Zone expansion to Nordstadt on existing public transport services and proposes necessary adjustments to bus and tram lines.

## 2. Current Public Transport Network in Nordstadt
Nordstadt is currently served by:
- **Tram lines:** 4, 8, 12
- **Bus lines:** 154, 237, 330, N8 (night bus)
- **Frequency:** Peak hours: 10‑min intervals, off‑peak: 20‑min intervals

## 3. Expected Changes in Demand
With the LEZ expansion, a modal shift from private cars to public transport is anticipated. Estimates based on similar LEZ expansions suggest:
- **Short term (first year):** +15% passenger numbers on lines serving Nordstadt
- **Medium term (3‑5 years):** +25‑30% passenger numbers

## 4. Required Service Adjustments

### 4.1 Tram Network
- **Line 4:** Extend terminus from "Hauptbahnhof" to "Nordstadt‑Süd" (2 additional stops).
- **Line 8:** Increase frequency from 10‑min to 7.5‑min during peak hours.
- **Line 12:** Introduce short‑turn services between "Nordstadt‑West" and "City‑Center" to relieve congestion.

### 4.2 Bus Network
- **Line 154:** Reroute to cover the new residential area "Nordstadt‑Ost". Adjust timetable to 15‑min intervals (currently 20‑min).
- **Line 237:** Increase vehicle capacity (replace standard buses with articulated buses).
- **Line 330:** Introduce express service during morning peak (6:00‑9:00) with limited stops.

### 4.3 Night Service
- **N8:** Extend operating hours on weekends (until 4:00 instead of 3:00) and add one additional vehicle.

## 5. Infrastructure Needs
- Construction of two new tram stops: "Nordstadt‑Süd" and "Nordstadt‑Ost".
- Expansion of the "Nordstadt" bus depot to accommodate additional vehicles.
- Installation of real‑time passenger information displays at all stops within the expanded LEZ.

## 6. Environmental and Operational Benefits
- Reduction of private car trips estimated at 5,000 vehicle‑km per day.
- Corresponding decrease in NO₂ emissions: approx. 0.8 t/year.
- Improved air quality at bus/tram stops due to electrification of bus fleet (planned 2027).

## 7. Implementation Timeline
| Phase | Activity | Target Date |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Finalise route adjustments | Q1 2026 |
| 2 | Public consultation | Q2 2026 |
| 3 | Infrastructure works (stops, depot) | Q3‑Q4 2026 |
| 4 | New timetable introduction | 1 Jan 2027 |
| 5 | Monitoring and evaluation | Ongoing from 2027 |

## 8. Financial Implications
- **Capital investment (stops, depot):** €2.5 million (already allocated in 2026 transport budget).
- **Operating costs (additional services):** €1.2 million per annum (covered by increased ticket revenue and municipal subsidy).

## 9. Recommendations
1. Proceed with the described service adjustments in parallel with the LEZ expansion.
2. Launch a targeted marketing campaign to inform residents about improved public transport options.
3. Establish a monitoring group (Public Transport Authority, Urban Planning Office, Environmental Agency) to evaluate the impact after one year.
