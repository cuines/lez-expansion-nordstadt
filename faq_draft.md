# Frequently Asked Questions – LEZ Expansion Nordstadt

*Draft for public communication – version 1.0*

---

## 1. Why is the Low Emission Zone being expanded?
Air quality measurements in Nordstadt have repeatedly exceeded the EU limit values for nitrogen dioxide (NO₂). Expanding the LEZ is a legally required measure under the Clean Air Plan to protect residents' health and achieve compliance with European law.

## 2. Which area will be affected?
The expansion covers the Nordstadt district, roughly bounded by the railway line in the north, the river in the east, Hauptallee in the south and Industriepark in the west. A detailed map is available on the city website.

## 3. When will the expansion take effect?
The new rules will enter into force on **1 January 2026**. A six‑month grace period (until 30 June 2026) applies for residents and businesses registered inside the new zone.

## 4. Which vehicles are allowed to enter the expanded zone?
Only vehicles with a **green emission sticker (Grüne Plakette)** will be permitted after the grace period. Vehicles with yellow or red stickers, as well as vehicles without any sticker, will be prohibited.

## 5. Are there any exemptions?
Yes. The following vehicles are exempt:
- Emergency vehicles (police, fire brigade, ambulance)
- Vehicles of severely disabled persons (marked with “aG”, “H” or “BI”)
- Classic cars (older than 30 years, “H” licence plate)
- Tractors and agricultural machinery used for local work
- Commercial delivery vehicles registered in the city’s logistics register (Euro 6d‑TEMP or better)
- Vehicles of the German Armed Forces, Federal Police and customs on official duty

## 6. I live in Nordstadt and my car has a yellow sticker. What should I do?
During the grace period (1 Jan – 30 Jun 2026) you may still use your vehicle. After that date, you will need to either:
- Retrofit your vehicle with a certified particle filter (if eligible for a green sticker),
- Replace your vehicle with a low‑emission model,
- Switch to public transport, cycling or car‑sharing.

## 7. How can I get a green sticker?
Green stickers are issued by authorised testing centres (TÜV, DEKRA, GTÜ), vehicle registration offices (Kfz‑Zulassungsstelle) and many car workshops. You will need your vehicle registration document (Fahrzeugschein) and a small fee (approx. €5–15). Vehicles meeting Euro 4 (petrol) or Euro 6 (diesel) standards normally qualify.

## 8. Will public transport be improved?
Yes. The Public Transport Authority is extending tram lines 4 and 8, increasing frequencies on several bus lines, and building new stops in Nordstadt. A detailed timetable will be published before the end of 2025.

## 9. How will the new rules be enforced?
Automatic number‑plate recognition cameras will be installed at entry points to the zone. Vehicles without a valid green sticker (after the grace period) will receive a fine of €100 (passenger cars) or €200 (commercial vehicles). Repeat offenders face higher penalties.

## 10. Where can I find more information?

- Hotline: 0800‑123456 (Monday–Friday 8:00–18:00)

## 11. How can I give feedback or raise concerns?
A public consultation period will run from 1 March to 30 April 2026. You can submit comments via the online form on the city website or by post to the Urban Planning Office.
